            "Annotated Abstract: Transposable elements are genomic parasites that expand within and spread between        genomes(1). PIWI proteins control transposon activity, notably in the        germline(2,3). These proteins recognize their targets through small RNA        co-factors named <piRNA>PIWI-interacting RNAs</piRNA> (<piRNA>piRNAs</piRNA>), making <piRNA>piRNA</piRNA> biogenesis a key        specificity-determining step in this crucial genome immunity system.

Dysregulation of <piRNA>piRNAs</piRNA> has been noted in diverse human diseases including        cancers.
